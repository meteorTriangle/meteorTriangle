## About Me
Hello! Iâ€™m **Triangle Alien**, 24 years old, and passionate about electronics engineering and hardware design, with a special focus on embedded systems and low-power display technologies. Iâ€™m currently an electronics engineer and the founder of [Triangle Alien Studio](https://tindie.com/stores/trianglealienstudio/), where I develop innovative electronic products like E-Paper Modules, DIY development tools, and other fun tech gadgets.

My passion lies in blending creativity with technology to empower the maker community and developers to bring their wildest project ideas to life. When Iâ€™m not designing circuits, you might find me in the lab or exploring quirky hardware projects!

## Skills & Expertise
- **Core Areas**: Embedded systems, STM32 microcontrollers, E-Paper technology, hardware design.
- **Programming Languages**: C/C++, Python, Javascript.
- **Tools & Platforms**: STM32CubeMX, KiCad, Arduino, Raspberry Pi.
- **Project Types**: Low-power displays, parallel output systems (e.g., HUB75), IoT devices.

## Projects & Works
This GitHub repository serves as my personal project hub, documenting my work in embedded systems and hardware design. Here are some key projects:
- **[Triangle Alien Studio E-Paper Module](https://hackmd.io/@TriangleAlien/Skk4QKgskl)**: A 2.13-inch four-color (red, black, yellow, white) E-Paper module with a resolution of 122x250 pixels and a refresh time of ~16 seconds, perfect for DIY and low-power applications.
- **Other Fun Projects**: Ongoing, including smart labels, IoT prototypes, and development tools.

Feel free to explore the code, notes, and design documents in this repositoryâ€”they reflect my passion and expertise in electronics engineering.

## Future Plans
My goal is to further optimize the E-Paper Module (e.g., reducing refresh time, increasing supported sizes and resolutions) and explore more innovative electronic products, such as wearable devices or smart display systems. I also plan to open-source more code and resources, so feel free to contribute or share your ideas!
